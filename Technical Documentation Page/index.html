                  <h2>Frequent Asked Questions about HTML</h2>
                 <h3>Why HTML is important for web development?</h3><div class="bot">
          <code>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating and designing web pages. Understanding HTML is fundamental for anyone entering web development, as it forms the backbone of every web page.

</code></div>
<h3>What are HTML tags and how do they work?</h3>
      <div class="bot"> <code>HTML uses tags to define elements on a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (“< >”), and they come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between these tags specifies the element. </code></div>
          <h3>What software do I need to learn HTML?</h3>
     <div class="bot">    <code>You only need a simple text editor, like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac. For Output, you’ll need a web browser, like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

</code></div>
<h3>What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?</h3>
        <div class="bot">  <code>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, introducing new elements, attributes, and APIs that enhance web development capabilities. While HTML5 maintains compatibility with older HTML versions, it brings new features like native support for video and audio, improved form handling, and enhanced semantics. Learning HTML5 is recommended for staying current with modern web development practices.</code></div>
          
          <h3>Can I create a complete website with just HTML?</h3>
       <div class="bot">  <code>Yes, You can build a simple website with just HTML, but it will be very basic. For a visually appealing and interactive website, you’ll also need CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for dynamic elements).

            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. The Hypertext defines the link between web pages, and Markup defines the text document within tags to structure the web pages. This language annotates text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand and explain the workings of HTML with examples.</p>
            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
          <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is used to create webpages. It uses HTML tags and attributes to describe the structure and formatting of a web page.</p>
          
          <p>HTML consists of various elements, that are responsible for telling search engines how to display page content. For example, headings, lists, images, links, and more.</p>
          <ul>
          <h2>Features of HTML</h2>
          
            <li>It is easy to learn and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is platform-independent.</li>
            <li>Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.</li>
            <li>Hypertext can be added to the text.</li>
            <li>It is a markup language.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HTML Elements and Tags</h2>
            <p>HTML uses predefined tags and elements that instruct the browser on how to display the content. HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. It’s important to remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.</p>
           
             <p>This section will dive into the basic structure of an HTML page, which includes essential building-block elements like doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements.

             <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
              <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</p>
              
               <p>An HTML document can be created using an HTML text editor. Save the text file using the “.html” or “.htm” extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</p>
               
                <p> <h2>Note:</h2> Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (MacOS). Other advanced text editors include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Froala, etc.</p>
                <h2>HTML History</h2>
                 <p>HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.</p>
                 
                  <p>Currently, we are using HTML5, which is the latest and most recent version of HTML.

            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Websites. It is used to describe the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of elements that tell the browser how the content is displayed on the screen. We’ll walk you through fundamental HTML examples and teach you how to create a webpage. This HTML Basics covers fundamental HTML examples.</p>
          <p>In this guide, the basics of HTML include learning HTML tags ( &lth1>, &ltp>, &ltimg>, etc), attributes, elements, and document structure which collectively form a working web page.</p>
          <h2>Basic HTML Document</h2>
          <p>Every HTML document begins with a document type declaration, setting the foundation for the webpage. This section introduces basic HTML tags that structure the page, such as &lthead>, &ltbody>, and &lttitle>. Although this is not mandatory, it is a good convention to start the document with the below-mentioned tag. </p>
            <p>The basic HTML tags that divide the whole page into various parts like head, body, etc. </p>
            <h2>HTML Headings</h2>
             <p>The HTML heading tags are used to create headings for the content of a webpage. These tags are typically placed inside the body tag. HTML offers six heading tags, from &lth1> to &lth6>, each displaying the heading in a different font size.</p>
              <p>To demonstrate the use of 6 heading tags from &lth1> to &lth6> in HTML.</p>
               <p><h2>HTML Paragraph and Break Elements</h2></p>
                <p>HTML &ltp> tags are used to write paragraph statements on a webpage. They start with the &ltp> tag and end with &ltp>. The HTML &ltbr> tag is used to insert a single line break and does not require a closing tag. In HTML, the break tag is written as &ltbr>.</p>
                 <p>To illustrates the use of &ltp> tag for writing a paragraph statement in HTML.</p>
                  <p>To illustrates the use of the &lthr> tag for the horizontal line in HTML.</p>
          <ul>
            <h2>View HTML Source Code</h2>
            <li>While checking a web page, you might want to see the HTML code behind it. Here we will see how you can view HTML source code for the entire page or a specific element.</li>
            <li>To view the source code of a webpage press ctrl + u on the page, or right-click on the page and select the “view page source” option.</li>
            <li>This will open a new tab that shows the HTML source code for that entire page.</li>
            <li>To check the HTML code for a specific element on a page, right-click on the page and select the “Inspect” option.</li>
            <li>This lets you see the HTML and CSS behind that element. You can also try making changes and see the changes.</li>
